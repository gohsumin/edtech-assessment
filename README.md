## Lab 1: Coding environment, GitHub, and basics of Python
So far, we've learned how to set up VS Code, create our own GitHub account, and write our first Python code. In this assignment, you and your partner will work together to create a shared repository containing code of your design.

#### Activities/discussions
1. Create a shared repository between you, your partner, and the instructor.
2. Discuss the concepts you and your partner learned this week. What was the most challenging, and what excites you the most? Why? Check the Board of Increasing Knowledge in the classroom and tape new index cards on it with anything — either a description of a key concept or an example of it — that's not yet on the board.
3. From in-class activities, we were able to write lines of code that simulate various simple calculators and "chatbots" from what we've learned so far. Discuss what other programs might be possible to make solely with variable assignment, input/output, and expressions.

#### Assignment details/submission
1. **Monday**: decide as a group on what your program will do and how you might achieve this using only the concepts from the class so far. Don't worry, we will increase the scope as you learn more!
2. **Tuesday**: choose one member to be the "driver" and the other the "navigator" during discussion and pair programming. The driver has access to the keyboard while the navigator simultaneously observes the screen and makes suggestions to the driver. Have the driver submit a pull request (a request to merge their changes into the main repository) by midnight, although it is likely that you will finish by the end of class time.
3. **Wednesday**: the navigator reviews the pull request, adds comments where necessary, and approves the pull request only if applicable.
4. **Thursday**: the navigator explains how the review went to the driver. If the navigator requests changes, the driver should make new commits to the pull request by the end of the night. If the navigator approves the pull request, the driver and navigator should change roles for the final changes.
5. **Friday**: final discussion with the group and a brief, in-class, 10-minute presentation from each group. Students will be equally assessed on demonstration of conceptual understanding and good teamworking efforts (demonstated through in-class discussion, code reviews, and presentation).



#### Notes
1. In actual practice, I would also include some starting code in this repository that the teams can "fork" into their shared repositories.
2. Based on student progress, I may decide to make some changes in these assignments such as how many days/weeks they span, the sizes of groups, and the frequency of the assignments/rotations.
3. As the material becomes more complex, I may assign every student to a full developer role to match their increasing proficiency as well as need for more practice.
